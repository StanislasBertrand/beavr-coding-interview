# Beavr Coding interview

## The assignment : Full-Stack Document Processing App

### **Objective**

Build a minimal full-stack web application that allows users to:

1. **Upload documents** (e.g., text or PDF files).
2. **Summarize documents and extract key elements**.
3. **Bonus : Ask questions based on the document content** and receive AI-generated responses.

### **Expectations & Time Limit**

- The assignment should take no more than **2 hours** to complete.
- Focus on **functionality over polish**â€”the goal is to demonstrate problem-solving and full-stack development.
- Keep the solution **simple and maintainable**.

### **Requirements**

### **Backend**

- Implement a **REST API** (Node.js/Express, Flask, FastAPI, or similar) that supports:
  - File upload and storage.
  - Document summarization and key element extraction
  - **Bonus :** Answering questions based on the document content.
- Use **SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB** (or an in-memory solution) to store data

### **Frontend**

- Create a **simple web UI** that allows users to:
  - Upload documents.
  - View the extracted summaries and key points.
- **Bonus:** Ask questions and see AI-generated answers.
- Minimal but **functional UI** is sufficient

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. Provide a **GitHub repository link** with clear instructions to run your app.
2. Include a **README** explaining:
   - Tech stack choices.
   - How to install and run the application.
   - Any trade-offs made due to time constraints.
3. Ensure the code is **well-structured and documented**.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Completeness**: Does the app cover all the core functionalities?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, readable, and well-organized?
- **Technical Choices**: Are the selected tools/libraries appropriate for the task?
- **Efficiency**: Does the app process documents effectively?
- **User Experience**: Is the UI intuitive and functional?

Good luck! ðŸš€

## Run the app

This repository contains a full stack app template you can use for this assignment.

### Backend

Dependencies :

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install "fastapi[all]" "uvicorn[standard]" sqlalchemy
```

Run the app :

```
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

If necessary, install node : https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
